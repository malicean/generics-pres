# generics-pres

A presentation I gave at [ACM's Presentation Night](https://acm.umn.edu/events/2023-11-08-presentation-night/).
Only the slides were presented. The folders were for my own exploration to prepare the talk.

Its purpose is to show what generics solve, and how they can be used to solve a simple, case-studiable problem.
In this way, I hope to explain to people why generics exist and why they are a nice language feature, rather
than a headache that many languages employ to be evil.
